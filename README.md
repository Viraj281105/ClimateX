# üìà ClimateX

**A Real-Time Climate Intelligence & Policy Impact Platform, built for India.**

*Project for the PCCOE IGC Hackathon (Demo Due: Nov 15th)*

---

## üéØ Hackathon Goal: An "India-First" Intelligence Platform

Our goal is to move beyond generic global dashboards. ClimateX is a lean, modular platform optimized for the hackathon by focusing on **India-specific datasets** to deliver **causal insights** and **actionable policy recommendations**.

We are building four key modules to demonstrate this:

1.  **Real-Time India Dashboard:** A live geospatial dashboard showing rainfall, emissions, and crop data from Indian sources (IMD, CPCB).
2.  **Causal Policy Engine:** A "DoWhy-lite" engine to answer counterfactual questions like, *"What would be the causal impact on Delhi's AQI if Policy X was adopted?"*
3.  **Live Sentiment Analyzer:** A lightweight BERT model to track public sentiment on climate issues, state-by-state, using Twitter and news data.
4.  **Policy Recommender:** A RAG-based pipeline to suggest relevant, proven policies for different Indian states based on their unique climate challenges.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

We are using a simplified 5-layer design to build a fast, modular, and deployable demo.

1.  **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** React.js, Mapbox, and Recharts for a fully interactive UI.
2.  **Application Layer (Backend):** A high-speed FastAPI backend to serve data and control model execution.
3.  **Intelligence Layer (AI/ML):** A set of containerized services for Causal Inference (DoWhy), NLP (HuggingFace BERT), and Policy Recommendation (RAG).
4.  **Data Layer (India-Specific):** A dedicated data store using PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
5.  **Integration Layer (ETL):** Simple cron jobs and REST APIs (falling back from Airflow) to fetch data from Indian portals.
